					<p class="product-description"><strong>A shot clock</strong> is a countdown timer used in a variety of games and sports, proving a set amount of time				
						that a team may possess the object of play before attempting to score a goal. Back then in the days of yore, shot clocks were set on 
						the ground in the corner of the court. This was an obvious problem since it could be a visual obstruction if there are five or six players standing 
						in the way. Now the shot clock you most commonly see is <em><b>the three or four-sided shot version</b></em>, giving players and even fans an all-around view of how
						much time they have to lauch a shot. This 360 view may not be the saving grace for every play, but it has made the game a whole lot better.

					<p class="product-description">While watching cricket you might have noticed, whenever the wicketkeeper stumps the batsman, 
					the bails over the stumps fall and quickly light into colorful led. These are actually <strong>smart bails</strong> that were launched In 2013 by a firm named 
					<em>Zing Bails</em>. When the bails were properly freed from the stumps, the goal was to make them glow. A microchip in the bails senses when touched 
					amongst the stumps and the bails are lost. The bails are powered by a low-voltage battery, which lights up in less than 1/1000th of a second. 
					The 3rd umpire now analyses run-outs and stumpings swiftly. And the LED lights add a unique touch to the game for the spectators, especially 
					during night games.

					<h3>HANS(Head And Neck Support) Device</h3>

					<p class="product-description">A <strong>HANS device</strong> is a type of head restraint, a safety device in motorsports. 
						Head restraints are mandatory when competing with most major motorsports 
						sanctioning bodies. They reduce the likelihood of head or neck injuries, 
						including the often fatal basilar skull fracture, in the event of a crash.
						There are many such devices on the market today, but the HANS is the original and the most common.
						intended to limit the forces that the head and neck of the driver have to deal with in the event of 
						a crash. <em>The HANS system is a 1980 invention by a professor at Michigan State University named Dr. Robert Hubbard</em>.
